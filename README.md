# Fast C++ CSV Parser
This is a small, easy-to-use and fast header-only library for reading comma separated value (CSV) files.

Note: the **only difference of this fork** compared to [the original repo](https://github.com/ben-strasser/fast-cpp-csv-parser) **is CMake support** and a slightly adjusted project structure. However, since the author ["does not intend to maintain a `CMakeLists.txt` for a single header file"](https://github.com/ben-strasser/fast-cpp-csv-parser/pull/93#issuecomment-932715936), it is added here. Apart from that, this repo tracks the original one.

See original [README](include/fast-cpp-csv-parser/README.md) for more information.
